# A brief reflection on ML Systems ü§ñ‚úíÔ∏è

In November 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT. [Fast foward to June 2023, and it occupies the first two most searched queries worldwide, according to Google trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2022-11-29%202023-07-01&hl=en), experiencing [a sharp increase in search around that time](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2022-11-29%202024-03-18&q=%2Fg%2F11khcfz0y2&hl=en-US). Moreover, at the end of that year its annual recurring revenue crossed $2B, a 900% increase comparing to an estimated $200M at the end of 2022 ([Sacra](https://sacra.com/c/openai/)). These great figures are followed by an equally great spend to keep the system working: [ChatGPT could cost over $700000 per day to operate](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-chatgpt-costs-openai-to-run-estimate-report-2023-4#post-headline), with inference costs being worst than training costs, [say Dylan Patel and Afzal Ahmad in SemiAnalysis](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/the-inference-cost-of-search-disruption). This hints something interesting: **ML systems are not just about ML algorithms**. They are also about the entire ML system, including not only the infrastructure and the training, but also the data, the business requirements, and the logic for monitoring, and updating your models (besides, of course, developing). In few words: the needs of an AI system in research and in production are different.

[OpenAI has shown the world that ML can be a nifty tool for a lot of problems](https://hbr.org/2022/12/chatgpt-is-a-tipping-point-for-ai). However, it is not a magic that can solve all of them. Even for problems that ML can solve, ML solutions might not be the optimal solutions. Before starting an ML project, you might want to ask whether ML is necessary or cost-effective. As a quick reminder, [OpenAI has a funding of $11.3bi and valuation of $80bi](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/openai/__kElhSG7uVGeFk1i71Co9-nwFtmtyMVT7f-YHMn4TFBg), while [Facebook had a funding around $1.3bi (excluding loans) and was evaluated at $50bi](https://fortune.com/2011/01/11/timeline-where-facebook-got-its-funding/). It shows how much money does a large AI company requires to achieve a given valuation when compared to a non-AI one (at that time Facebook was not interested on AI). A last important point is that ML algorithms may cause a whole set of troubles: [bias](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/08/14/can-ai-be-as-unethical-and-biased-as-humans/?sh=2dce8d0c6878) and [unethical use](https://www.vox.com/2020/6/8/21284005/urgent-threat-deepfakes-politics-porn-kristen-bell), [data privacy](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/privacy-paradox-with-ai-2023-10-31/), among many others.
