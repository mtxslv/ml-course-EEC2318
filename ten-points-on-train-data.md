# Intro

Even though the funny part (the curriculum focus) of ML is modelling, data mishandling can sink the entire ML operation. It happens because it is  full of potential bias, caused by collection, sampling, or labelling. Once the models are trained on them, these issues are perpetuated. Moreover, data in production is constantly changing in volume and characteristic. Thus, obtaining or creating training data is fundamental, as this iterative process evolves through the project lifecycle.
